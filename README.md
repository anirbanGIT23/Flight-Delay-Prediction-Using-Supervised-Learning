#  Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Overview
This project predicts **flight delay duration (in minutes)** using historical flight and weather data. The model helps airlines and passengers estimate expected delays before departure, improving scheduling efficiency and passenger satisfaction.

The workflow includes **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and inference** using a large dataset (~3 million rows, 32 columns).

##  Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing and inconsistent values  
- Encoded categorical variables using label/one-hot encoding  
- Normalized numerical features where needed  
- Removed outliers and irrelevant columns  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized distribution of delays, correlations, and feature importance  
- Identified peak delay times, routes, and carriers with the most delays  

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Created new temporal features (e.g., day of week, hour of day)  
- Derived weather-based and route-based delay indicators  
- Optimized feature set based on correlation and importance  

### 4. **Model Training**
- Compared multiple regression models:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor *(final model)*  
- Tuned hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation  

### 5. **Evaluation Metrics**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**  

### 6. **Inference**
- Generated predictions on unseen (test) data  
- Saved model for later deployment or batch prediction
